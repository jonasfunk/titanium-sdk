Create GitHub Release

Purpose
- Create a new GitHub release on the fork with updated version, changelog, and release notes.

Usage
- Trigger this command and include the version number in your message, e.g. `13.3.0`.
- Optionally specify `--prerelease` for RC/beta releases.

Steps
1) Ensure we are at the repo root: `/Users/jonasfunk/Udvikling/titanium-sdk`.
2) Verify `gh` CLI is authenticated.
3) Extract version from user message (e.g. `13.3.0`).
4) Update version in `package.json` to the new version.
5) Run `npm install --package-lock-only` to update `package-lock.json`.
6) Find the last release commit by searching for "chore(release): bump version" in git log.
7) List all commits since the last release using `git log <last-release-commit>..HEAD --oneline --no-merges`.
8) Update `CHANGELOG.md` with new features (feat), bug fixes (fix), and community credits based on commits.
9) Check if tag already exists - abort if it does.
10) Create release with CHANGELOG.md as release notes.
11) Open the release URL in browser for review.

Notes
- Always update `package.json` and `package-lock.json` before creating release.
- Use `--notes-file CHANGELOG.md` to include the full changelog in release notes.
- Use `--prerelease` for RC, beta, or other non-stable releases.
- Use `--target <branch>` if releasing from a branch other than master.
- You can edit the release notes on GitHub after creation.
