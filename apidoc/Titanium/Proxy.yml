name: Titanium.Proxy
summary: The base for all Titanium objects.
description: |
    On platforms that use native code (Android and iOS), the `Proxy` type represents a
    JavaScript wrapper or _proxy_ around a native object. Setting or getting a property
    on a proxy object results in a method invokation on the native object. Likewise,
    calling a method on the proxy object results in a method invokation on the native
    object.

    Some Titanium objects are _createable_: new instances of these objects can be created using
    factory methods. For example, a [Window](Titanium.UI.Window) object can be created using the
    <Titanium.UI.createWindow> method.

    In general, developers should avoid modifying the prototype of a Titanium object, or
    adding methods to a Titanium object. (Adding a simple property such as an ID value is
    generally OK.)

    Some Titanium objects are not represented by native objects, so they exist only as 
    JavaScript objects.

    ## Subclassing Titanium.Proxy

    The Proxy class is not intended to be subclassed by developers. To create custom 
    objects based on Titanium.Proxy, see <Titanium.Module>.

methods:
  - name: addEventListener
    summary: Adds the specified callback as an event listener for the named event.
    parameters:
      - name: name
        summary: Name of the event.
        type: String
      - name: callback
        summary: Callback function to invoke when the event is fired.
        type: Callback<Titanium.Event>

  - name: removeEventListener
    summary: Removes the specified callback as an event listener for the named event.
    description: |
        Multiple listeners can be registered for the same event, so the
        `callback` parameter is used to determine which listener to remove.

        When adding a listener, you must save a reference to the callback function
        in order to remove the listener later:

        ``` js
        var listener = function() { Ti.API.info("Event listener called."); }
        window.addEventListener('click', listener);
        ```

        To remove the listener, pass in a reference to the callback function:
        
        ``` js
        window.removeEventListener('click', listener);
        ```
    parameters:
      - name: name
        summary: Name of the event.
        type: String
      - name: callback
        summary: Callback function to remove. Must be the same function passed to `addEventListener`.
        type: Callback<Titanium.Event>

  - name: hasListener
    summary: Returns `true` if the proxy has listeners for the specified event name.
    description: |
        This method allows you to check if the proxy has any event listeners 
        registered for a specific event type without having to maintain your own
        listener tracking.

        Example usage:

            var view = Ti.UI.createView();
            
            console.log(view.hasListener('click')); // false
            
            view.addEventListener('click', function() {
                console.log('Clicked!');
            });
            
            console.log(view.hasListener('click')); // true

    parameters:
      - name: name
        summary: Name of the event to check.
        type: String
        
    returns:
        type: Boolean
        summary: Returns `true` if the proxy has listeners for the specified event, `false` otherwise.

  - name: removeAllListeners
    summary: Removes all listeners for the specified event, or all listeners for all events if no event name is specified.
    description: |
        This method provides a convenient way to remove multiple event listeners at once.
        It is particularly useful for cleanup operations when destroying views or 
        resetting proxy state.

        If called with an event name, removes all listeners for that specific event:

            var view = Ti.UI.createView();
            view.addEventListener('click', function() { console.log('Handler 1'); });
            view.addEventListener('click', function() { console.log('Handler 2'); });
            view.addEventListener('swipe', function() { console.log('Swipe handler'); });
            
            view.removeAllListeners('click'); // Removes both click handlers
            console.log(view.hasListener('click')); // false
            console.log(view.hasListener('swipe')); // true (swipe handler still present)

        If called without arguments, removes all listeners for all events:

            view.removeAllListeners(); // Removes ALL event listeners
            console.log(view.hasListener('swipe')); // false

        This method removes both named function listeners and anonymous function listeners.

    parameters:
      - name: name
        summary: |
            Name of the event to remove all listeners for. 
            If not specified, removes all listeners for all events.
        type: String
        optional: true
        
    since: "11.0.0"

  - name: fireEvent
    summary: Fires a synthesized event to any registered listeners.
    parameters:
      - name: name
        summary: Name of the event.
        type: String
      - name: event
        optional: true
        summary: A dictionary of keys and values to add to the <Titanium.Event> object
            sent to the listeners.
        type: Dictionary

  - name: applyProperties
    summary: Applies the properties to the proxy.
    description: |
        Properties are supplied as a dictionary. Each key-value pair in the object is applied to the proxy such that
        myproxy[key] = value.
    parameters:
      - name: props
        summary: A dictionary of properties to apply.
        type: Dictionary

properties:
  - name: bubbleParent
    summary: Indicates if the proxy will bubble an event to its parent.
    description: |
        Some proxies (most commonly views) have a relationship to other proxies, often
        established by the add() method. For example, for a button added to a window, a
        click event on the button would bubble up to the window. Other common parents are
        table sections to their rows, table views to their sections, and scrollable views
        to their views. Set this property to false to disable the bubbling to the proxy's parent.
    type: Boolean
    default: true
    platforms: [iphone, ipad, android, macos]
    since: {android: "3.0.0",  iphone: "3.0.0",ipad: "3.0.0", macos: "9.2.0"}

  - name: apiName
    summary: The name of the API that this proxy corresponds to.
    description: |
      The value of this property is the fully qualified name of the API. For example, [Button](Titanium.UI.Button)
      returns `Ti.UI.Button`.
    permission: read-only
    type: String
    platforms: [android, iphone, ipad, macos]
    since: {android: "3.2.0",  iphone: "3.2.0",ipad: "3.2.0", macos: "9.2.0"}

  - name: lifecycleContainer
    summary: The Window or TabGroup whose Activity lifecycle should be triggered on the proxy.
    description: |
      If this property is set to a Window or TabGroup, then the corresponding Activity lifecycle event callbacks
      will also be called on the proxy. Proxies that require the activity lifecycle will need this property set
      to the appropriate containing Window or TabGroup.
    type: [Titanium.UI.Window, Titanium.UI.TabGroup]
    platforms: [android]
    since: "3.6.0"

events:
  - name: focus
    summary: Fired when the proxy gains focus.
    since: "0.1"
    
  - name: blur  
    summary: Fired when the proxy loses focus.
    since: "0.1"
